        <p className="about-paragraph">
            Hi there! I’m <strong>Sanat Misra</strong>, a passionate developer, aspiring software engineer, and a competitive athlete.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
            I’ve been actively playing cricket for years and have competed at a national level. One of my proudest achievements is playing for the 
            professional cricket team, <strong>Seattle Thunderbolts</strong>, where I honed my skills, teamwork, and leadership abilities.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
            Academically, I’m pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the University of California, Irvine. My passion lies in solving 
            complex problems, designing innovative solutions, and exploring emerging technologies to make a meaningful impact in the world.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
            When I’m not coding or playing cricket, you can find me diving into personal projects, learning about AI and full-stack development, 
            or mentoring others in programming and technology.
        </p>
        <p className="about-paragraph">
            I believe in pushing boundaries, whether it’s in the field of cricket, in academic pursuits, or while brainstorming the next big idea in tech. 
            Feel free to connect with me to chat about cricket, software development, or anything in between!
